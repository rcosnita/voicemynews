# Summary

This document provides the technical summary for implementing VoiceMyNews so that most of the code is cross platform. The goal of the design is to provide common code for all platforms and also to allow UI to be added for each specific platform. Like this we can obtain a unique feeling for each individual platform and we can benefit from the latest APIs available.
