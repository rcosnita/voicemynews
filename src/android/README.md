# Summary

Here comes the implementation for Android platform.

# Target devices

At this point we support devices running an Android API higher than 19.

# Getting started

The setup is really simple because we have all third binaries brought in as submodules. Follow the steps below to clone the repo:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:rcosnita/voicemynews.git
cd voicemynews
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This is it. Now you can open the project in Android Studio and enjoy coding.
