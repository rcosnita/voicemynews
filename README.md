## JS business logic

JS code is cross platform and we recommend using Sublime for developing more business logic. We already provide a sublime project which also provides all build systems.

In order for the project to work on your platform you need to:

1. Add node in your PATH.
1. Add npm in your PATH.

You can now open the project in Sublime, click on Tools -> Build System and select the build you want to execute. 

## Windows 10

In order to have everything setup on a development machine you must follow the steps described in [Windows 10 Readme](src/win10/README.md).
